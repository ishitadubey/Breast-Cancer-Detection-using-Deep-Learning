# Breast-Cancer-Detection-using-Deep-Learning
According to world health organisation, cancers occur in women who have no known risk factors for the disease. Breast cancer affected 2.3 million women globally in 2020, with 685000 fatalities. Breast cancer had been diagnosed in 7.8 million women in the previous five years as of the end of 2020, making it the most common cancer in the world. Automatic classification of malignant and non-cancerous tissue histopathological microscopic images is a key job related with this work, and it would be a useful 
computer-aided diagnosis tool for clinicians. 

We undertook trials on the Breast Histopathology Images dataset, which is unbalanced across classes, in this publication. 
And additionally, they no longer offer a cease solution. Existing works in literature suggest that Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is today the state-of-the-art approach to solving several complex problems, including medical picture analysis, and in particular on histopathology picture classification. However, class-imbalanced statistics can probably put a poor effect on the performance of CNN during the parameter learning. 

So, we want to propose a methodology with the help of which, we could see reduction in the negative impacts on the performance of CNN in order to produce much more refined results which can be used to detect breast cancer at an early stage.

Metrics used to evaluate - precision, recall, f1-score and support


In this experiment, we found that Convolutional Neural Network has an accuracy of 86.11% which is certainly better than Artificial Neural Network with accuracy 80%.
The two images that we used as test cases to predict from the dataset only were predicted accurately by the model. Our final Convolutional neural network model 
outperformed all other models in the study. Artificial Neural Network with fully connected layers is not suitable for image recognition and related tasks but 
Convolutional neural network models perform very well with the images and give some outstanding results.
